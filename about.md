## About

DEHApad is a really very simple - light notepad application. It is not for programmers or writers. The main feature of the program "was" the sidebar-behavior. Once, there was a good software called Google Desktop. And as its user, I liked it very much. In addition to showing time, hard disk or network information, most of them I liked the notepad part. I used that for years. However, Google stopped to support it. There are some sidepad applications for Windows. However, they are huge and full of non-necessary features. I wanted a notepad sitting at the side. Therefore, as an old amateur Delphi programmer, I have started to code DEHApad with open source and free state-of-art IDE Lazarus and programming language Free Pascal. 

With the time passed and by changing habits, I started to not use this sidebar-feature. With the version 6, which was released at Apr 2021, this sidebar-feature is removed and distraction-free mode for writing is added. And also, by changing habits, I started to use FP/L less and less with time. It did its mission well in the past. I even used it in my company to write commercial applications. However, I am mostly using Python in my daily life and in my academic studies now and therefore I decide to rewrite DEHApad in Python from scratch. First Python versıon of DEHApad will be the version 7 and it will be released in (hopefully) April 2022.

I am a true believer of free software movement. However, I do not plan to make DEHApad open-source. This is my hobby project, and I want it to stay like this. Thanks for understanding. Thank you for visiting, and maybe for trying the DEHApad.

## Versioning
For a one-man small project, I am not using traditional versioning scheme. I am simply using the following linear formula: 

*version = [(d1- d0)/dstep ] + versionstart*

Where *d1*, *d0* and *dstep* are version date, project starting date and version major number step time, respectively. And *versionstart* is the first major number used for first built. For the DApad, d0 is the project start date until Version 0.26.21, with the Version 2.0, d0 is Deha's birthdate, dstep = 365.2422 days and versionstart = 0.0.
