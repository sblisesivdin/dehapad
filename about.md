## About

DEHApad is a really very simple - light notepad application. It is not for programmers or writers. The main feature of the program is the sidebar-behavior. Once, there was a good software called Google Desktop. And as its user, I liked it very much. In addition to showing time, hard disk or network information, most of them I liked the notepad part. I used that for years. However, Google stopped to support it. There are some sidepad applications for Windows. However, they are huge and full of non-necessary features. I wanted a notepad sitting at the side. Therefore, as an old amateur Delphi programmer, I have started to code DEHApad with open source and free state-of-art IDE Lazarus and programming language Free Pascal. This will be just a hobby. I think it will become a mature product at the end of 2017 with my personal feedback for bug-fixes. Thank you for visiting, and maybe for trying the DEHApad.

## Versioning
For a one-man small project, I am not using traditional versioning scheme. I am simply using the following linear formula: 

*version = [(d1- d0)/dstep ] + versionstart*

Where *d1*, *d0* and *dstep* are version date, project starting date and version major number step time, respectively. And *versionstart* is the first major number used for first built. For the DApad, d0 is the project start date until Version 0.26.21, with the Version 2.0, d0 is Deha's birthdate, dstep = 365.2422 days and versionstart = 0.0.
