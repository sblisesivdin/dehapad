## Latest News

**April 2021**
* Happy birthday Deha! Deha is 6 years old, today (Apr 21st). And new version of DEHApad v.6.00 comes in order. In this release, sidebar behaviour is changed to a distraction-free mode. Sidebar mode becomes problematic with each new Windows 10 update. Therefore, code is changed to have a distraction-free mode, instead of having a sidebar. More information can be found in [Dev](development.md) page. BTW, this was the last version of DEHApad that is written in Freepascal/Lazarus. FP/L has been done its mission well to me in the last decade. Even, I used it in my company. However, time is changed and I am mostly using Python for my needs. So it is time to move my hobby code to Python! I will try to move all current features of DEHApad 6 to version 7. I do not plan to announce a new version until Apr 21st, 2022. If someone uses DEHApad, they must know this :)
